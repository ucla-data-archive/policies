      <description>R Workshop for the Masters of Social Science (MSS) program.
Introduction to R for non-programmers using gapminder data.
The goal of this lesson is to teach novice programmers to write modular code and best practices for using R for data analysis. R is commonly used in many scientific disciplines for statistical analysis and its array of third-party packages. We find that many scientists who come to Software Carpentry workshops use R and want to learn more.</description>

Three common options for storage are text files, spreadsheets, and databases. Text files are easiest to create, and work well with version control, but then we would have to build search and analysis tools ourselves. Spreadsheets are good for doing simple analyses, but they don’t handle large or complex data sets well. Databases, however, include powerful tools for search and analysis, and can handle large, complex data sets.</description>

      <description>Tim Dennis, Harrison Dekker, and Juliane Schneider Fri, 27 Oct, 10:00–12:00, Room 4 Force11 2017  A fundamental challenge for open science is how best to create and share documents containing computational results. Traditional methods involve maintaining the code, generated tables and figures, and text as separate files and manually assembling them into a finished document. As projects grow in complexity, this approach can lead to procedures which are error prone and hard to replicate.</description>

      <description>LOCATION: Powell Fishbowl Time: 10am-noon Date: Sept. 22, 2017 Register: http://calendar.library.ucla.edu/event/3603414
A follow-up Open Refine class to cover some topics we didn&amp;rsquo;t get to cover in the Library Carpentry on 9-8. We&amp;rsquo;ll pick up on how to do more transformations in Open Refine including split and join operations. We&amp;rsquo;ll then explore the wonderful world of using Open Refine to enhance our data with data from external sources, including CrossRef, Virtual International Authority File (VIAF), and WikiData.</description>
