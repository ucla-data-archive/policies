<p>PURPOSE</p>

<p>This document describes the policies and practices followed by the Data Archive with respect to acquisitions and archiving of research data.  It will be used to work with faculty and research units where surveys and other data formats are generated in the course of research and where there is a desire for long term management of these materials.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Over the years, the ability to manage a collection of raw data files used in social research has been directly linked to the technology available for doing so.  Data archives need a robust computing infrastructure to carry out routine procedures on the data files to ensure their viability and usability.  When computing platforms and operating systems change; when statistical packages change; and when tools for creating descriptive information and metadata about data changes, the archival operation, including its policies, must change too.  Therefore this document on acquisitions and archiving will evolve over time to adapt to a changing technological environment.</p>

<p>In addition, issues with respect to respondent privacy and confidentiality, copyright, ownership, and reuse of data are evolving and changing in terms of what is ethical, acceptable and legal. This document will also be revised according to changes in university and regulatory policies and laws and will reflect established best practices in social research and data curation and preservation.</p>

<p>The policies described in this document include sections on the kinds of research data we will accept for deposit, formats, details on collection size limitations, metadata and responsibilities for producing metadata, depositor eligibility, data quality, confidentiality, rights and ownership, categories of access to deposited data, and preservation plans.</p>

<p>This document will be reviewed annually and revised.  Version changes will be noted.</p>

<h2 id="content-coverage">Content Coverage</h2>

<p>This section describes the kinds and formats of materials accepted for deposit.</p>

<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>

<p>The Archive will manage materials focused on social research broadly defined: <em>Scientific inquiry which measures, describes, explains and predicts changes in social and economic structures, attitudes, values and behaviours and the factors which motivate and constrain individuals and groups in society.</em></p>

<p>Materials are accepted in any language.  Depositors will be encouraged to provide translations of non-English materials into English. Depositors should provide bibliographic level metadata in English.</p>

<p>The Archive reserves the right to refuse to accept materials which will be difficult or impossible to process given the resources, staff, facilities or capacities of the Archive operation.</p>

<h3 id="kinds-of-research-data">Kinds Of Research Data</h3>

<p>The Archive may accept</p>

<ul>
<li>Models and simulations, consisting of two parts: the model with associated metadata and the computational data arising from the model (see also file size limitations, Section 1f.)</li>
<li>Observations where the data will usually constitute a unique and irreplaceable record, including surveys, censuses, voting records, field recordings, etc.</li>
<li>Derived data resulting from processing or combining ‘raw’ or other data (where care may be required to respect the rights of the owners of the raw data)</li>
<li>Accompanying material including codebooks, data collection instruments, questionnaires, data collection methods and techniques, coding instructions, interviewer guides, graphic flow charts of data collection, summary statistics, database dictionaries, project summaries and descriptions, bibliographies of publications pertaining to the data, and links to virtual or online tools.</li>
<li>All materials must be in electronic format.  No paper items accepted.  No completed questionnaires accepted.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="status-of-the-research-data">Status Of The Research Data</h3>

<p>The Archive may accept</p>

<ul>
<li>Raw data accompanied by complete documentation (See also metadata types and sources, section 2c.)</li>
<li>Data ready to be used by persons unfamiliar with the original project</li>
<li>Data that are publicly available; data should be de-identified</li>
<li>Data that can be used  if certain owner-specified conditions are met</li>
<li>Summary/tabular data associated with publications</li>
<li>Derived data</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="versions">Versions</h3>

<p>The Archive maintains information about each version of a dataset.</p>

<ul>
<li>Version details are recorded in master file for the data</li>
<li>Version details may be recorded in a DDI metadata record</li>
<li>Multiple copies of the same data in different statistical formats may be kept</li>
<li>Version details are recorded for different copies of files or materials held in different formats</li>
<li>All versions of the same data are publicly available unless the depositor requests that an earlier version be restricted from access</li>
<li>Persistent identifiers, when assigned, will always point to the latest and most complete version and will be linked to the original file(s) where this ensures accurate manipulation of the data</li>
<li>The original copy of data file(s) and documentation are retained as deposited</li>
<li>Supplementary digital objects are stored with the original data file(s)</li>
<li>Subsets or supplementary data file(s) are stored with the original data file(s)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="data-file-formats">Data File Formats</h3>

<p>Statistical (quantitative) data may be accepted as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Portable system files in SAS, SPSS and/or STATA.</li>
<li>ASCII format files are preferred as long as they are accompanied by data definition statements for specific software applications.</li>
<li>Excel or other spreadsheet format files should be converted to tab- or comma-delimited text</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-statistical data in electronic format (no paper files) are accepted for:
* Textual qualitative data in TXT, PDF, or word processing format
* Supplemental materials in PDF or word processing software
* Image files in JPEG, GIF format
* Audio files in AIF, WMA or WAV format
* Video files in MPEG2 or MPEG4 format
* Compressed files are accepted as long as they can be uncompressed using commonly available software such as 7-Zip or Winzip.</p>

<p>Format caveats:</p>

<ul>
<li>Every attempt will be made to ensure that file formats will be converted to newer versions of proprietary software (ex. SPSS, STATA, Word) or to new formats, however the Archive cannot guarantee that specific formats will always be converted or remain readable and useful.</li>
<li>Preference is given to commonly used file formats that are easily converted to open or non-proprietary formats meeting ISO standards.</li>
<li>Statistical files may be converted to ASCII as an additional file format.</li>
<li>Persistent identifiers, when assigned, will always link to the latest and most complete version.</li>
<li>Where there are multiple formats, the Archive will maintain records to describe each version and format.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="volume-and-size-limitations">Volume And Size Limitations</h3>

<ul>
<li>There are currently no restrictions on file sizes, or number of files.  However, the Archive reserves the right to refuse to accept materials which are of a volume which may make it difficult or impossible to process given the resources, staff, facilities or capacities of the Archive operation.</li>
<li>When necessary, materials may be stored in compressed format.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="metadata">Metadata</h2>

<p>This section concerns various forms of metadata, including administrative, descriptive, technical, structural, and preservation, using established standards to ensure adequate description and control over the long term.</p>

<ul>
<li>Anyone may access the metadata free of charge. Access to some or all of the metadata may be controlled.</li>
<li>Use and reuse of metadata is governed by policies and procedures of the University of California.</li>
<li>Metadata created by the Archive may be used in another medium with written permission and provided there is a link to the original metadata and/or this repository is mentioned.</li>
<li>Using metadata created by the Archive for commercial purposes is not permitted.</li>
<li>The Archives repository system will aim to allow metadata harvesting of dataset descriptions by other institutions following the OAI-PMH guidelines, or other harvesting protocols provided written permission is obtained prior to harvesting, and resources of the Archive permit.</li>
<li>The Archive may produce full descriptive metadata using the DDI XML standard for uniquely held items. This metadata may be re-usable when written permission is obtained and provided there is a link to the original metadata and/or this repository is mentioned.</li>
<li>Depositors of data to be uniquely held by the Archive should allow the reuse of metadata.</li>
</ul>

<p>###Metadata Types And Sources</p>

<p>Data deposited by researchers should be accompanied by detailed documentation that describes the data, and the processes used to create it. Examples of documentation include but are not limited to codebooks for data files, code for software programs, format specifications, technical reports describing sampling, weighting and other protocols or methods.  Data files not accompanied by documentation are not accepted.  The following types of metadata will be created from accompanied documentation in the following forms:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Descriptive metadata</dt>
<dd>The Archive may create MARC and Dublin Core compatible records for inclusion in online library catalogs, such as the UCLA Library, or OCLC WorldCat. Additional finding aids and guides will be created as appropriate using available technology and resources. The Archive will maintain full information relating to the content, structure, context and source of the data; information about the methods, instruments, and techniques used in the creation or collection of the data. Where possible, the Archive will record bibliographic information about publications using the data and will provide links to online versions of those publications.</dd>
<dt>Administrative metadata</dt>
<dd>The Archive will maintain details on the data file storage format, access conditions or limitations, copyright and licensing information, and any other information needed for long term maintenance.</dd>
<dt>Structural metadata</dt>
<dd>Where appropriate the Archive may maintain details about data files that link together in some logical way. The Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) will be used with multiple format collections where appropriate and where resources permit. METS will be used to encourage the reuse and repurposing of multiple format collections but will not be used as a substitute for full descriptive metadata using the DDI XML or other format standards for uniquely held items.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="metadata-schemas">Metadata Schemas</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Archive will employ the DDI XML metadata schema for uniquely held items.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="submission-of-data-ingest">Submission Of Data (Ingest)</h2>

<p>This section describes policies for depositing data and covers who is eligible to deposit data, data quality, confidentiality of data, embargo, and depositor rights.</p>

<h3 id="eligible-depositors">Eligible Depositors</h3>

<ul>
<li>Members of the UCLA faculty, students and staff are eligible to deposit data types and formats which are described in the Content Coverage (section 1a through 1f) portion of this document.</li>
<li>Potential depositors from outside the UCLA community may be considered when materials offered meet the Content Coverage policies outlined in this document.</li>
<li>Acceptance of materials is not guaranteed.</li>
<li>Depositors may only deposit their own work.</li>

<li>Submitted materials will be checked by the Archive at the time of deposit to ensure that data integrity has been fully maintained during the transfer process.</li>
<li>Data sets are compared with data documentation to ensure that there is a match between variables, variable labels, values and value labels and that the number of observations and variables matches the stated numbers in study documentation.
Digital videos are viewed in spots and descriptive information on title, participants, dates, and recording details are verified with the depositor.</li>
<li>Digital audio recordings are listened to in spots and where necessary converted to a sharable or preservation format. Descriptive information on title, participants, dates, and recording details are verified with the depositor.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="data-quality-requirements">Data Quality Requirements</h3>

<h4 id="responsibility">Responsibility</h4>

<ul>
<li>Depositors of data (Data Producers) are responsible for the quality of their research data. The Data Archive will be responsible for the quality of storage and access to data.</li>
