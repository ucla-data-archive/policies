## Our Services and the Data Life Cycle

The Data Archive provides data services that are tied to the data life-cycle.


###### *"Data archiving is a process, not an end state where data is simply turned over to a repository at the conclusion of a study. Rather, data archiving should begin early in a project and incorporate a schedule for depositing products over the course of a project’s life cycle and for the creation and preservation of accurate metadata, ensuring the usability of the research data itself. Such practices would incorporate archiving as part of the research method.”  Preserving Research Data, Jacobs and Humphrey (2004)*

## Data Management Plans

A data management plan is a document that describes what you will do with your data _during_ your research and _after_ you complete your research.   


## Required By:  
* Funding Agencies  
* Publishing  
* Sharing and Archiving Data   
* Reproducibility of Research  
* Lastly, regardless of the requirements, good data management is an essential skill for researchers.
