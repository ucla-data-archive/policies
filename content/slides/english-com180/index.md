## Data can be
]
.right-column[
* **Observational**: Captured in real-time, typically outside the lab
  * Examples: Sensor readings, survey results, images, audio, video
* **Experimental**: Typically generated in the lab or under controlled conditions
  * Examples: test results
* **Simulation**: Machine generated from test models
  * Examples: climate models, economic models
* **Derived /Compiled**: Generated from existing datasets
  * Examples: text-as-data (text mining), compiled database, 3D models

]
.right-column[
* **Text**: field or laboratory notes, survey responses, interview transcripts, focus groups
  * Numeric: tables, counts, measurements
* **Audiovisual**: images, sound recordings, video
  * Models, computer code, geospatial data
* **Discipline-specific**: FITS in astronomy, CIF in chemistry
* **Instrument-specific**: equipment outputs

.left-column[
## Microdata
]
.right-column[
* Data directly observed or collected from a specific unit of observation.
* Contain individual cases, usually individual people, or in the case of Census data, individuals & households
* Examples:
  * Census: the unit of observation is probably an individual, a household or a family.
  * Survey or poll: the responses of a single respondent

.right-column[
* Is higher-level data that have been compiled from smaller units of data.
  * Examples: inflation rate, consumer price index, demographic data for city or state

##Datasets
]
.right-column[
A dataset or study is made up of the raw data file and any related files, usually the **codebook** and **setup files**.
Most data sets require at least basic statistical analysis (Stata, SPSS, R, etc.) or spreadsheet programs (Excel) to use.

.left-column[
## Recap
]
.right-column[
* Data are **raw ingredients** from which statistics are created.
* Statistical analysis can be performed on data to show relationships among the variables collected.
* Through secondary data analysis, many different researchers can re-use the same data set for different purposes.

.left-column[
## Who would collect the data?
]
.right-column[
1. Could it have been collected by a government agency?
2. A nonprofit or nongovernmental organization?
3. A private business or industry group?
4. Academic researchers, i.e. you?
]

.left-column[
## Publications
]
.right-column[
## Look for publications that use the kind of data you’re looking for and that cite the dataset

* In other words, is the data you want mentioned in scholarly articles or government reports or some other source?
* [ICPSR (Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research) Data-Related Publications Search](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/citations/index.jsp) - Database of publications that use ICPSR data.

.left-column[
## Using Data
]
.right-column[
## What kind of analysis do you want to perform?
* Preparing data for analysis is often 60-80% of work
* Are you using a statistical software tool?
  - R, Stata, Python, Excel?
  - Some repositories provide setup files & clean data for specific programs
- Are more interested in qualitative methods?
  - Text analysis, text classification, interviews, ethnographies

.left-column[
## Identify Variables & Your Research Problem
]
.right-column[
### What aspects of your topic are you interested in?
* It's often helpful to think in terms of variables when looking for data.
  * The effects of **educational attainment** on **income**.
* Factoring in geographies and time components can also help narrow down sources

.left-column[
##Find/collect data
]
.right-column[
## Once you know that what you want exists, it's time to hunt it down

* Is it freely available on the web?
* Or part of a package to which the library already subscribes?
* Can it be requested directly from the researcher?
* Will you need to interview or survey people?

#Using data

* Data can come in many formats (xls, csv, txt, etc.)
* Data from resources above can also come with setup files and codebooks
* You often will have to prepare the data for analysis (60-80% of the work)

## Data sharing and publishing   
]
.right-column[
* Funding agencies and journals are increasingly requiring researchers to share their data
* A data repository is a collection of datasets that have been deposited for storage and findability.
* They are often discipline specific and/or affiliated with a research institution
* They typically will give the researcher a DOI, persistent link to their data

### Examples
* [ICPSR](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/)
* [Harvard Dataverse Network](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/)
* [Roper Center](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/)
* [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)
* A recommended list by subject from PLOS: <http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories>
* Many others: <https://www.re3data.org/> lists over **2,000**
