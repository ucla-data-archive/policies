## Data Life Cycle

The Data Science Center provides services that are tied to the data life-cycle.


###### *"Data archiving is a process, not an end state where data is simply turned over to a repository at the conclusion of a study. Rather, data archiving should begin early in a project and incorporate a schedule for depositing products over the course of a project’s life cycle and for the creation and preservation of accurate metadata, ensuring the usability of the research data itself. Such practices would incorporate archiving as part of the research method.”  Preserving Research Data, Jacobs and Humphrey (2004)*

## How do I know this study useful?

* Raw data are __not__ eye-readable
* To decipher data you will use __Questionnaires and Codebooks__

![illustration: Raw Data](./images/rawData.jpg "Raw Data sample")  

---

## What is a Questionnaire?  

* A __questionnaire__ is a _research instrument_ consisting of a series of _questions_ and other prompts for the purpose of gathering information from respondents.  

* Questionnaires cover separate topics such as:
	* Preferences (e.g. political party)
    * Behaviors (e.g. food consumption)
    * Facts (e.g. gender)

* Questionnaires can include indexes or scales:
	* Latent traits (e.g. personality traits)
    * Attitudes (e.g. towards immigration)
    * An index (e.g. Social Economic Status)

## Questionnaire: ABC New Poll
![illustration: Questionnaire ABC New Poll](./images/codebook01.jpg "Questionnaire ABC New Poll")  

---

## What is a Codebook?

* An overview of the study or dataset
* Variable names and descriptions
* Column locations (mostly this is for raw data)

### May also include:
* Test of questions if the data comes from a survey
* Example of the Questionnaire
* Detail on who responded to the survey

# Data Management Plans

* What is a Data Management Plans
* Why do I need this?
* What tools are available to help?


---

## What is a Data Management Plan?

A data management plan is a document that describes what you will do with your data _during_ your research and _after_ you complete your research.


---

## Why do you need this?

* Funding Agencies
* Publishing  [https://dataden.library.ucla.edu/jspui/](https://dataden.library.ucla.edu/jspui/)  ORCID:[https://orcid.org/](https://orcid.org/)
* Sharing and Archiving Data
* Regardless of the requirements, good data management is an essential skill for researchers.
