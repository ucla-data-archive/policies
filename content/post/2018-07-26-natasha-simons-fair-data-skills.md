Please join us for the following talk given by Natasha Simons, the Associate Director, Skilled Workforce with the Australian Research Data Commons (ARD). She'll deliver a presentation entitled "Developing a (FAIR) skills program to facilitate data intensive research". The following is a description of topic of her talk. 

Uptake of Research Data Management services and infrastructure depends on skilled multi-disciplinary teams at universities and within research projects that cut across multiple institutions and research disciplines. The full benefits of research infrastructure cannot be realised if the research community is not aware of its existence, does not know how to access or use it, or does not understand how it can help them solve their problems. With this in mind, the Australian government has developed a National Research Infrastructure Roadmap that highlights the need for skills in order to enable the most effective use of sophisticated research facilities.

Refreshments will be served.
