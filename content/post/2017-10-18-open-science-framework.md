There are many actions researchers can take to increase the openness and reproducibility of their work. Please join us for a workshop, hosted by the Center for Open Science, to learn easy, practical steps researchers can take to increase the reproducibility of their work. The workshop will be hands-on. Using example studies, attendees will actively participate in creating a reproducible project from start to finish.

Topics covered:

* Project documentation
* Version control
* Pre-Analysis plans
* Open source tools like the Center for Open Science’s Open Science Framework to easily implement these concepts in a scientific workflow.
