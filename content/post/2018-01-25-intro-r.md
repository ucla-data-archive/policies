## Info

Date: Thursday, January 25, 2018
Time: 9:00am - 12:00pm
Location: Young Research Library, West Classroom
Categories: R (programming language)
Calendar: http://calendar.library.ucla.edu/event/3835760

This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools related to using R in the context of data analysis. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.  We'll cover:

* A basic introduction to R and RStudio
* Visualizing your data with ggplot2, the most popular graphing package in R
* Tidying and transforming data for analysis

You'll come out of the course with a good foundation on the most important tools in R for working and communicating with data.  If you want to delve more deeply into data visualization and manipulation, take our other courses:

## Resources

### Basic programming concepts

* Use the datacamp tutorials for an intro to basic programming concepts in R. 

* From the [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) course complete the following chapters.  As you work through the chapters, carefully note the important terms and what they are used for.  We recommend you do so in a notebook that you can easily refer back to.
    + [Chapter 1 Intro to basics](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r/chapter-1-intro-to-basics-1?ex=1):
        + Console pane: where you enter in commands
        + Objects: where values are saved, how to assign values to objects.
        + Data types: integers, doubles/numerics, logicals, characters.
    + [Chapter 2 Vectors](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r/chapter-2-vectors-2?ex=1):
        + Vectors: a series of values.
    + [Chapter 4 Factors](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r/chapter-4-factors-4?ex=1):
        + *Categorical data* (as opposed to *numerical data*) are represented in R as `factor`s.
    + [Chapter 5 Data frames](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r/chapter-5-data-frames?ex=1):
        + Data frames are analogous to rectangular spreadsheets: they are representations of datasets in R where the rows correspond *observations* and the columns correspond to *variables* that describe the observations. We will revisit this later in Section \@ref(nycflights13).
* From the [Intermediate R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-r) course complete the following chapters:
    + [Chapter 1 Conditionals and Control Flow](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-r/chapter-1-conditionals-and-control-flow?ex=1):
        + Testing for equality in R using `==` (and not `=` which is typically used for assignment). Ex: `2 + 1 == 3` compares `2 + 1` to `3` and is correct R syntax, while `2 + 1 = 3` is not and is incorrect R syntax.
        + Boolean algebra: `TRUE/FALSE` statements and mathematical operators such as `<` (less than), `<=` (less than or equal), and `!=` (not equal to).
        + Logical operators: `&` representing "and", `|` representing "or". Ex: `(2 + 1 == 3) & (2 + 1 == 4)` returns `FALSE` while `(2 + 1 == 3) | (2 + 1 == 4)` returns `TRUE`.
    + [Chapter 3 Functions](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-r/chapter-3-functions?ex=1):
        + Concept of functions: they take in inputs (called *arguments*) and return outputs.
        + You either manually specify a function's arguments or use the function's *defaults*.

### Tips on learning to code

* Learning to code/program is very much like learning a foreign language
* it can be very daunting and frustrating at first.
* put in the effort and are not afraid to make mistakes, anybody can learn.
