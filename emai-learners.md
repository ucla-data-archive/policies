Hello,

We are excited for the Intro to R workshop tomorrow, Oct. 16 from 2-4:30pm, at Young Research Library Presentation Room, Room 11348. Please note that the location for this workshop has changed!

Make sure you have the necessary software installed on your laptop:

* R  - Download and install R for your OS:  http://cran.stat.ucla.edu/
* RStudio - Download and install the RStudio Desktop: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

If you have any trouble, send us an email or come a little early Tuesday afternoon (like 1:30pm). Someone will be there by 1:30pm to help with installation issues.

If you won't be able to attend, please let us know so that we can offer your seat to someone on the waitlist.

Please read the Code of Conduct [http://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html] so that we all are aware of how to treat each other respectfully.

We are committed to making sure that the workshop is accessible to everyone. Please tell us if there is anything we should know in advance in order to make the workshop accessible for you (e.g. sign-language interpreters, large-print handouts, lactation facilities).

Let us know if you have any questions, otherwise we will see you Tuesday morning!

Looking forward to seeing you soon!

Cheers,

Tim Dennis <timdennis@ucla.edu>
