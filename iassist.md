Are you inspired to work in Data Science Center? We're looking for grad students to join us in Spring 2014.

We're looking for GSRs or Student Assistants to join our three active teams. We have an open, inclusive culture that values diversity and open exchange. We'll let you develop leadership in a particular area while working collaboratively with other students and staff.

Training, services, and outreach. Plan workshops and trainings, recruit and interview instructors, coordinate working groups, reach out to departments, run our user analytics. 1-2 positions, 10-20 hours/week.

Communications. Broad portfolio with specializations including website (Drupal), social media, graphic design, communications writing, photography, documentation, and ethnography. Support our development and outreach efforts. 1-2 positions, 10-20 hours/week.

Technology infrastructure. Tell us what you think we should be building, help us develop use cases and advocate across campus. We're particularly interested if you have experience with IPython Notebook, other open-source options for reproducible and collaborative research, or the Berkeley Data Analytics Stack (BDAS). 1-2 positions, 10-20 hours/week.

And we're always on the lookout for grad students who can teach their hard-won skills to other researchers. We'll interview you, support you, and embed you in an energizing environment.

Consultants. We're looking for one-on-one support across the tools/methods/data spectrum. Join our roster of active consultants. 2-4 hours/week.

Workshop instructors. As always, we invite you to propose workshops and trainings. Tell us what you'd like to see -- or what you could teach!

If you're interested ...

We have 2 fee remissions for grad staff working 20 hours/week. We welcome students who already have fee remissions from fellowships or other appointments and want to work 10 or more hours/week (as long as the terms of your appointment allow). Consultants and workshop instructors have smaller commitments. We typically take on first-year grad students in consultant and workshop instructor roles.

Email us a cover letter and a resume/cv. Tell us concretely what you can do in Data Science Center -- how can you help us serve our users, the more specific the better. If you have other experience (including outside academia) that strengthens your case, let us know. Tell us how many hours/week you're looking for and whether you need a fee remission.
